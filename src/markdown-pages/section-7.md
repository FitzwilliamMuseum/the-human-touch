The splayed hand, the clenched fist; political movements often deploy the symbolic power of the hand. Its image evokes protest and the refusal to submit, conveys agency and the desire for self-determination. Bound or shackled hands signal enslavement and de-humanisation. The extended hand supports those in need, reaches out across divisions, and seals the bond between individuals, communities, and nations.
